Before using this script for filling database tables of the Paranormal Distribution project with data in the SQLite DBMS, 
you have to delete absolutely all raws (exception - line with the admin account) in database tables: 

distribution_subject, 
distribution_grade, 
distribution_customuser_user_permissions, 
distribution_customuser_groups, 
distribution_customuser, 
distribution_studygroup. 

Next step, in opened project (in PyCharm IDE), write the commands mentioned in this script in terminal 
(be in folder ...\Paranormal_distribution\Back_end\practice).
